because Unit Tests will be ran in GitHub Actions. Feel free to run the Unit Tests with `npm run test` to test your
changes

### Updating README

`README` is in two places at the moment: root and `libs/tailwind/README.md`. The one in root is the one displayed on
GitHub while the one in `libs/tailwind` is being used on `npm`. When you make changes to `README`, make sure to update
both.

> A script can be created to automating this.
